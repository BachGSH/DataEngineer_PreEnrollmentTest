If each join will take about 30 hours, and I need to do daily report, my solution will be use data paritioning and Indexing. Paritioning the data can significantly improve query performance while Indexing can also speed up the retrieval of rows. 

Besides that, I can consider using Data Warehouse solution which is more optimized for large-scaled data processing and reporting.
